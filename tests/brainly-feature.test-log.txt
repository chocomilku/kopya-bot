    question: 'Rizal Wind Farm sa Pililla,Rizal​',
    answer: '<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The humming of the car engine was just about to lull us to sleep when I spotted a giant white fan sticking out in the distance. All of a sudden, everyone was alive, scanning the horizon, watching out for more.</p><p></p><p>If I didn’t know exactly where we were at the moment, I would easily assume we had reached Bangui in Ilocos Norte. But we were just driving for over an hour from Paete, Laguna, 
making our way back to Manila. And this place isn’t along the shores of Ilocandia but in the highlands of Rizal. Outside Ilocos Norte, it is the first of its kind in Luzon.</p><p></p><p>Located in the humble barangay of Halayhayin in Pililla, to be more precise, the Rizal Wind Farm is the newest addition to the growing list of tourism hotspots within close proximity of the capital, just two hours away. According to Alternergy Wind One Corp, the company that leads the operations of the farm, Pililla is an ideal setting for a wind farm because “it is part of a natural wind corridor created by the unique geographical features surrounding the lake.”</p><p></p><p>A lane of 27 wind turbines stand atop sloping hills at 300 meters above sea level, towering over Laguna de Bay and standing along the NW-SE line to capture the Amihan from October to March, whose speeds can reach 36km/hour. Each turbine can produce 2MW. The entire farm is estimated to be able to generate almost 150 Gigawatt hours of electricity every year.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> sana maka tulong</p><p></p>',
